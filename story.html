                    Hi Nicole, it's me Ethan!

                <p class="mb-3">
                    <span class="ps-10">So currently wala akong magawa and sabi ko what if I try something random since hindi ako makatulog at the same time hindi din naman kita kausap and wala din naman ako magawa aside from browsing on tiktok hahaha.</span>

                    <span class="ps-10">
                        So yes, I know na we are currently like testing the waters na we want to be sure of each other and I can say na naiintindihan ko sya talaga and kahit din naman ako is ganon din. I want to be like literally na maging sure sayo kasi it will be like unfair sayo if halimbawa na hindi pala ako sure sayo in the end.
                        Kaya, I hope maging happy ka on me okay? Kasi I'm going to try mybest for this to work out. Kahit malayo ka pa.

                        Nicole, even though we’ve just met online, it’s amazing how much of an impact you've already had on me. From our first conversation, first laught, first kwento, I could tell you’re someone truly special—someone with such genuine kindness, intelligence, and a depth that draws me in. Your positive mindset and the way you view life are inspiring, and I find myself looking forward to each message, every chat, and each new detail I get to learn about you.

                    <span class="ps-10">
                        It’s rare to meet someone who not only has good traits but lives by values that resonate so deeply with mine specially yung you're not playing anymore and wanting to date to marry already. I can’t help but feel a spark of excitement thinking about where this connection could lead us. You make me want to give my best, to show up fully, and to be someone you can rely on someone who brings joy and meaning to your life.

                    <span class="ps-10">
                        I realize we’re just beginning, but I want you to know I’m here, genuinely open to exploring something real and meaningful with you. I’m ready to invest time, effort, and care because I believe that this connection is worth it. I want to be someone who adds to your happiness, encourages your dreams, and makes life a little brighter simply by being a part of it.

                        Thank you for being so open and allowing me a glimpse into the wonderful person you are. I’m excited about this journey, wherever it may lead us, and I’m looking forward to creating something beautiful together.

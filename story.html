                    Hi Judith, it's me Ethan!
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    <span class="ps-10">So kagaya nga ng chat ko sayo, I think naman you became happy sa lsm ko sayo so let me do it my way.</span>

                        So yes, I know na we are currently like testing the waters na we want to be sure of each other and I can say na naiintindihan ko sya talaga and kahit din naman ako is ganon din. I want to be like literally na maging sure sayo kasi it will be like unfair sayo if halimbawa na hindi pala ako sure sayo in the end.
                        Kaya, I hope maging happy ka on me okay? Kasi I'm going to try mybest for this to work out. Kahit malayo ka pa.

                        Judith, meeting you online feels like one of those rare moments in life where everything just aligns perfectly. 
                    </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="ps-10">
                    From the very first conversation, it was like we had known each other forever. The way we clicked so effortlessly is something I wasn’t expecting but can’t stop smiling about. It’s not every day you meet someone who makes you feel so seen, understood, and at ease all at once. Like legit, di ko din talaga inakala na ganto sya ka compatible for me to do this kind of thing din out of nowhere hahaha.

                       I’ve been so happy getting to know you—your thoughts, your sense of humor, the way you look at life. Every little thing about you draws me in, and it’s exciting to imagine all the stories and moments we have yet to share. You have this incredible way of making even the simplest conversations feel special, and it’s a feeling I can’t quite put into words.
                    Sana mag continue lang yung kwento mo kasi I literally enjoyed everything from you, yung mga trivia mo and all, sana wag mag stop hahaha

                    <span class="ps-10">
                        I’m so grateful we crossed paths in this big, unpredictable world. It’s amazing how someone I’ve never met in person could already feel so familiar and meaningful to me. I truly look forward to learning more about you—the things you love, the moments that shaped you, and all the little quirks that make you, you. You’ve already brought so much light into my life, and I can’t wait to see where this connection takes us.

                        I hope pag gising mo, mabasa mo ito <3 Always remember na special ka and pag special ka, alam mo na, laging may pasobra na isa. So always remember na may ethan ka na since 2025 okay? Whatever happens, may ethan ka nang friend and magiging close friend pa lalo.

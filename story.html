                    Hi Korine, it's me again Ethan.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    <span class="ps-10"></span>Siguro nagtataka ka kung anong reason why I make this for you, it's because at some point I want you to know what I feel and kung anong nangyari sakin since day 1 until our first week.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    <span class="ps-10"></span>To be honest, it's kinda scary like legit kasi I feel na parang I fell to someone agad agad but I said to myself na I am willing to risk everything for this person kaya I am still here fighting for you. I want you to feel na dapat mo akong pagkatiwalaan at kaya kitang pasiyahin everyday. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    <span class="ps-10"></span>Dumaan ang ilang araw simula nung makilala kita, unti unti ko nang napapansin yung sarili ko nakangiti na everytime na nakakachat kita at the same time nakakausap kita. Nagiging mas vocal ako sa mga nafefeel ko and so on to be honest. Then dumating pa sa point na una kitang nakita through video call, sa totoo lang nahihiya ako nung time na yun pero you made me feel na maging kalmado lang nung time na yon. Your presence brings a sense of calm and joy to my life na never kong nafeel before. Chatting with you and spending my time with you everyday is a blessing, and I cherish every single moment we share, I hope maextend pa natin yun when we meet na personally. Then I experienced na you're sending me a photo of yours, then the moment I saw your smile, it lights up my day. Nakaranas din ako sayo na even though I know to myself na it is only a joke and just for you to bully me, your words like calling me "baby, love, mahal" is like a music into my ears that fills my heart and it feels like I can literally feel the warmth of your words that comforts my soul.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    <span class="ps-10"></span>I love the way you understand me without words, the way you support me without question, and the way you give me assurances without hesitation. I really felt na parang kilalang kilala mo na ko like your assurances hits the right spot on me. It made me feel na I want you to be my confidant, my partner and also my best friend. Your values, principles, mindset in life, patience and even though hindi mo pa nauunlock yung love is alam kong there's some unwavering love that makes me to be more inspired to become a better person.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    <span class="ps-10"></span>Right now, like after our first week, when i think about our future together, my heart fills with excitement and hope. Hoping na you're going to fight until the end like what I am doing right now with you, yung tipong we will give our 100% on this relationship. I dream of the adventures na makakasama kita, sa mga challenges na maoovercome natin and sa mga memories na magagawa natin at some point in time. I am grateful for every update, virtual hug, every conversation and every moment of silence that we share.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    <span class="ps-10"></span> Thank you for being you Aubrey, my baby, my love. Thank you for trusting me and liking me and I hope loving me. Thank you for making my life infinitely better just by being in it. I love you more than words can express and I want na mas palalimin pa yun sayo, I am so incredibly lucky to have you by my side.
